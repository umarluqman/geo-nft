# Course review
No fluffs and straight to the points, love how the imports are being commented in the starter files. It's short and sweet.

Learned a ton about TypeScript, GraphQL, Tailwind and Mapbox.

I bet [Blitz.js](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz) will make the course project even less code due to the zero API layer.

Tailwind is magical, might use it for performance-sensitive apps as the CSS is generated on build time. Otherwise, I just use Chakra UI for its components and flexibility.
